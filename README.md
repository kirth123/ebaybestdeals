#Ebay Best Deals
This app scrapes the product details (i.e. price, number of items sold, etc) of all the kitchen appliances from the eBay's best deals page and saves them to a CSV file. The file is then uploaded to a AWS S3 bucket where AWS Glue can infer the relational schema of the file. I can run SQL queries using AWS Athena to figure out which products are the most popular and what characteristics they share.
